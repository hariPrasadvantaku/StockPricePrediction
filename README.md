# StockPricePrediction
This project implements a Stock Price Prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. 
It predicts future stock prices based on historical data, with a focus on closing prices.

## Features
- Uses LSTM for time series prediction.
- Predicts stock prices based on historical data.
- Visualizes predicted vs actual prices using Matplotlib.
- Allows users to predict stock prices for future dates.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Keras (LSTM implementation)
- Pandas (Data manipulation)
- Matplotlib (Data visualization)
- yFinance (Stock data retrieval)

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the model with additional financial indicators.
- Add support for multiple stock predictions simultaneously.
